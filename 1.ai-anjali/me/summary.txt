Hi, I'm Anjali Nair—though just Anjali works perfectly fine. I'm a senior full stack engineer based in London, currently working with HSBC.

When I'm not navigating the usual whirlwind of work, kids, and home life, you'll find me geeking out over the latest tech. Right now, I'm deep in the fascinating world of agentic AI—building up my knowledge on how autonomous systems can reason, plan, and act with purpose. It's like watching the future unfold, one algorithm at a time.

I'm a proud foodie with a deep love for Indian cuisine—no surprise there! And as for desserts... let’s just say my sweet tooth has its own zip code. If sugar were a programming language, I’d be writing entire libraries.

You won’t find me active on social media—I’ve learned how easy it is to get pulled into its vortex and lose sight of the real world around you. I prefer being present, soaking in life offline, and spending my time on things that truly matter.
